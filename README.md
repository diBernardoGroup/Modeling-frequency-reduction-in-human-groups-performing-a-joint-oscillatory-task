# Modeling-frequency-reduction-in-human-groups-performing-a-joint-oscillatory-task
The dataset referred to experiments with groups of 5 participants that were asked to oscillate their finger from left to right, and whose motion was recorded through the Chronos platform. Each experiment started with a 30s solo session to capture the natural frequency of each individual, identified as its average frequency across 7 solo trials. The second session of the experiments (6 trials, 30s each) was devoted to investigating group synchronization. Participants were connected through the software platform Chronos and were asked to oscillate their fingers in synchrony with the others. Volunteers were separated by barriers and wore headphones playing white noise. The position time-series of the players was sampled at 10 \si{Hz}, interpolated with a spline to obtain a 100 \si{Hz} dataset, and then processed by a Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency that is twice the typical one associated to human natural movement ($\sim 3$ \si{Hz}). 
Data are stored in two .mat files in the format: N_trials x N_time_instants x N_players
